# LetterBoxDProjectV1

//In this project I have used the LetterBoxD website to automate and test the website. I have made all the paths dynamic so it can work on any computer as long as the code is download properly. I have all included all the brower drivers in the resources folder inside of the project.

My first TestCase: ValidateHomePageTest- Signs the super up with username and password, it also click all buttons and submit.

ValidateSortByTest: Makes sure all the movies are sorted based on name.

ValidateWelcomeSignTest: makes sure the welcome sign is present on the webpage.
